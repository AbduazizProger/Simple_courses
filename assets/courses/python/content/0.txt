Bold: Why Python?
Text: 
Text:	* Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).
Text:	* Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.
Text:	* Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other Text:	* programming languages.
Text:	* Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is Text:	* written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.
Text:	* Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.

Bold: Python Syntax compared to other programming languages
Text:
Text:	* Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.
Text:	* Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
Text:	* Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
