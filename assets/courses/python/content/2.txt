Title: Python Variables
Bold: Variable
Text: Variables are containers for storing data values
Bold: Creating Variables
Text: Python has no command for declaring a variable
Text: A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
Text: Example
Code: x = 5 
Code: Y = "John"
Code: print(x)
Code: print(y)
Output: 5
Output: John
Text: Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.
Text: Example
Code: x = 4       # x is of type int
Code: x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
Code: print(x)
Bold: Coasting
Text: If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
Text: Example
Code: x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
Code: y = int(3)    # y will be 3
Code: z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
Bold: Get the Type 
Text: You can get the data type of a variable with the -> type() function.
Text: Example
Code: x = 5
Code: y = "John"
Code: print(type(x))
Code: print(type(y))
Output: Int
Output: String
Text:
Bold: Single or Double Quoted?
Text: String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:
Text: Example
Code: x = "John"
Code: # is the same as
Code: x = 'John
Text: 
Bold: Case-Sensitive
Text: Variable names are case-sensitive.
Text: Example
Code: a = 4 
Code: A = "Sally"
Code: #A will not overwrite a
Bold: Python - Variable Names
Text: Variable Names
Text: A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
Text:	* A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
Text:	* A variable name cannot start with a number
Text:	* A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Text:	* Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
Text:	* A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.
Text: Example
Text: Legal variable names:
Code: myvar = "John"
Code: my_var = "John"
Code: _my_var = "John"
Code: myVar = "John"
Code: MYVAR = "John"
Code: myvar2 = "John"
Text: Example
Text: Illegal variable names: 
Code: 2myvar = "John"
Code: my-var = "John"
Code: my var = "John"
