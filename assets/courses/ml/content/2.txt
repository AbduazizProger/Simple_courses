 Title:Machine Learning - Standard Deviation
 Bold:What is Standard Deviation?
 Text:Standard deviation is a number that describes how spread out the values are.
 Text:    A low standard deviation means that most of the numbers are close to the mean (average) value.
 Text:    A high standard deviation means that the values are spread out over a wider range.
 Text:Example: This time we have registered the speed of 7 cars:
 Code:speed = [86,87,88,86,87,85,86]
 Text:The standard deviation is:
 Code:0.9
 Text:Meaning that most of the values are within the range of 0.9 from the mean value, which is 86.4.
 Text:Let us do the same with a selection of numbers with a wider range:
 Code:speed = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97]
 Text:The standard deviation is:
 Code:37.85
 Text:Meaning that most of the values are within the range of 37.85 from the mean value, which is 77.4.
 Text:As you can see, a higher standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.
 Text:Use the NumPy std() method to find the standard deviation:
 Code:import numpy
 Code:speed = [86,87,88,86,87,85,86]
 Code:x = numpy.std(speed)
 Code:print(x)
 Bold:Variance
 Text:Variance is another number that indicates how spread out the values are.
 Text:In fact, if you take the square root of the variance, you get the standard deviation!
 Text:Or the other way around, if you multiply the standard deviation by itself, you get the variance!
 Text:To calculate the variance you have to do as follows:
 Text:1. Find the mean:
 Code:(32+111+138+28+59+77+97) / 7 = 77.4
 Text:2. For each value: find the difference from the mean:
 Code:32 - 77.4 = -45.4
 Code:111 - 77.4 =  33.6
 Code:138 - 77.4 =  60.6
 Code:28 - 77.4 = -49.4
 Code:59 - 77.4 = -18.4
 Code:77 - 77.4 = - 0.4
 Code:97 - 77.4 =  19.6
 Text:3. For each difference: find the square value:
 Code:(-45.4)2 = 2061.16
 Code:(33.6)2 = 1128.96
 Code:(60.6)2 = 3672.36
 Code:(-49.4)2 = 2440.36
 Code:(-18.4)2 = 338.56
 Code:(- 0.4)2 = 0.16
 Code:(19.6)2 = 384.16
 Text:4. The variance is the average number of these squared differences:
 Code:(2061.16+1128.96+3672.36+2440.36+338.56+0.16+384.16) / 7 = 1432.2
 Text:Use the NumPy var() method to find the variance:
 Code:import numpy
 Code:speed = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97]
 Code:x = numpy.var(speed)
 Code:print(x)
 Bold:Standard Deviation
 Text:As we have learned, the formula to find the standard deviation is the square root of the variance:
 Code:√1432.25 = 37.85
 Text:Or, as in the example from before, use the NumPy to calculate the standard deviation:
  Text:Use the NumPy std() method to find the standard deviation:
  Code:import numpy
 Code:speed = [32,111,138,28,59,77,97]
 Code:x = numpy.std(speed)
 Code:print(x)
  Bold:Symbols
 Text:Standard Deviation is often represented by the symbol Sigma: σ
 Text:Variance is often represented by the symbol Sigma Squared: σ2
 Bold:Chapter Summary
 Text:The Standard Deviation and Variance are terms that are often used in Machine Learning, so it is important to understand how to get them, and the concept behind them.
