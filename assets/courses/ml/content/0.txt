 Title:What is machine learning ?
 Text:Machine learning is teaching computer to learn from studying data and statistics. Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.
 Bold:Data Set
 Text:In the mind of a computer, a data set is any collection of data. It can be anything from an array to a complete database.
 Bold:Example of an array:
 Code:[99,86,87,88,111,86,103,87,94,78,77,85,86]
 Bold:Example of a database:
 Table-Row:Carname:BMW,Volvo,VW,VW
 Table-Row:Color:red,black,gray,white
 Table-Row:Age:5,7,8,7
 Table-Row:Speed:99,86,87,88
 Table-Row:AutoPass:Y,Y,N,Y
 Text:From looking to these examples we can get statistics that we want.
 Bold:Data Types
 Text:To analyze data, it is important to know what type of data we are dealing with. We can split the data types into three main categories:
 Bold:Numerical
 Bold:Categorical
 Bold:Ordinal
 Bold:Numerical data
 Text:Numerical data are numbers, and can be split into two numerical categories:
 Bold:  Discrete Data
 Text:  - counted data that are limited to integers. Example: The     number of cars passing by.
 Bold:  Continuous Data
 Text:  - measured data that can be any number. Example: The  price of an item, or the size of an item
 Bold:Categorical data
 Text:Categorical data are values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: a color value, or any yes/no values.
 Bold:Ordinal data
 Text:Ordinal data are like categorical data, but can be measured up against each other. Example: school grades where A is better than B and so on.
 Text:By knowing the data type of your data source, you will be able to know what technique to use when analyzing them.
